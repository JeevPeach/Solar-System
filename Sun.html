<h2> What is Sun? </h2>
<p> The sun lies at the heart of the solar system, where it is by far the largest object. It holds 99.8% of the solar system's mass and is roughly 109 times the diameter of the Earth â€” about one million Earths could fit inside the sun. </p>
<br>
<p>The surface of the sun is about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit hot, while temperatures in the core reach more than 27 million F, driven by nuclear reactions. One would need to explode 100 billion tons of dynamite every second to match the energy produced by the sun, according to NASA.</p>
<br>
<p>The sun is one of more than 100 billion stars in the Milky Way. It orbits some 25,000 light-years from the galactic core, completing a revolution once every 250 million years or so. Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen, the rest is mostly helium, with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon and iron. </p>
